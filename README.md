Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail order data to derive meaningful insights. It demonstrates key data preparation and transformation processes, including handling missing values, creating new features, and storing the processed data in a database for further analysis.

The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle dataset: Retail Orders.

Key Features
Data Loading: Extract and load retail order data from a compressed file.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and standardize column names for consistency.
Feature Engineering: Derive new columns such as discount, sale_price, and profit.
Database Integration: Store the cleaned and processed data into an SQL Server database.
Time Management: Convert order dates into a standard datetime format.
Project Structure
SQL File: Contains SQL code for database operations and transformations (sql_code.sql).
Python Script: Implements the data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process (orders_data_analysis.py).
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/data_analytics_project.git
cd data_analytics_project
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas sqlalchemy kaggle
Download the dataset from Kaggle:

Ensure you have a Kaggle API key set up (Instructions).
The script will automatically fetch the dataset using Kaggle's API.
Usage
Run the Python script: Execute the script to perform the following:

Download the dataset
Process the data (clean, transform, and derive new features)
Load the processed data into an SQL Server database
bash
Copy code
python orders_data_analysis.py
Database Configuration:

Update the connection string in the script with your SQL Server details:
python
Copy code
engine = sal.create_engine('mssql://<username>@<servername>/<database>?driver=ODBC+DRIVER+17+FOR+SQL+SERVER')
Example Analysis
